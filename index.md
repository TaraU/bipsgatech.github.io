# Welcome to BiPS

BiPS is a graduate student organization dedicated to Biomedical Photonics through both Georgia Tech and Emory University and share a vision of facilitating future leaders in Biomedical Photonics community in both academy and industry.

     Diverse optical microscopy system has enabled for interdisciplinary research to facilitate the understanding of a variety of biomedical target with high speed, high resolution, and multi-status environment. However, optical microscopists, especially students, have an limited access to fully understand the focal point where newly developed system could be applicable and critical needs from users. Likewise, young biologists and neuroscientists also suffer from the lack of understanding of how recent optical microscopy systems work while using core optical imaging facilities.

     With exceptional opportunities under BME and BioE department, we want to form a student organization and apply external funds and sources to address mutual understandings how biomedical photonics can bridge the gap and provide methods for questions from diverse interdisciplinary fields. Our student organization will be operated by graduate students mainly researching on biomedical photonics and will initiate multiple academic and out-reach events co-hosted with diverse biomedical student organizations and institutions.

     This student organization will foster an environment where all members can find unique opportunities to develop into future leaders in academics and industry in the rapidly growing field of biomedical photonics. Prepared plans of academic visits, industrial visits, and social events will enable for members to expand their professional networks and be aware of broad options that members can pursue to launch new paths after graduation, contributing to optical society and for future generations of scientists.

     We believe passion is highly contagious and this organization will be the space to share and facilitate positive environment as a united community of biomedical photonics.
