One of the primary issues while imaging thick biological samples is overcoming scattering, that increases with penetration depth, so that sufficient numbers of photons reach the region of interest. Typical fluorescence microscopy that rejects any out-of-focus light using a pinhole can usually only image samples about 100 μm thick. We know that longer wavelengths of light are scattered less and hence higher penetration depth could be achieved by trying to excite fluorescence using wavelengths in the infrared region of the spectrum. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is able to achieve much higher penetration depth through the multiphoton absorption phenomenon, where two or more photons of lower energy are simultaneously absorbed to provide sufficient energy to excite the fluorophore that would normally be excited using a single photon of high energy UV or blue light. This effect is non-linear in the sense that the probability of excitation depends on the mth power of the incident light intensity, where m is the non-linear order.  This non-linear effect means that regions in a very tight focal spot are excited unlike the typical cone of excitation seen in conventional fluorescence microscopy. This means that the pinhole that is typically used to block out-of-focus light can be omitted, increasing the sensitivity of the detection. MPM can image samples that are 1-2 mm in thickness and has become popular for in-vivo imaging of neural activity in mice and other organisms. As with conventional fluorescence, MPM images are acquired by raster scanning the field of view using galvo mirrors, and physically moving the objective or translating the sample in z in order to acquire different planes. The mechanical movement in z is often a bottleneck for high speed imaging, and scan rates of <10 Hz can be achieved with this method. However, neural activity is often on millisecond time scales, and the circuits of interest have structurally and functionally distinct components at different depths or axial positions.

Several different strategies have been adopted to improve the imaging speed. Some early approaches used different types of tunable lenses to move in z by tuning the lens to adjust the focus instead of mechanical motion. These methods improved speed but were limited to the focussing capabilities of these lenses and could only achieve a limited range of axial focussing. Other methods involve non-uniformly sampling 3D space such as Random Access Sampling, where only specific points of interest are imaged, and while these very fast, spatial resolution is significantly compromised and information is lost. Another set of methods use multifocus illumination or extended focus to produce 2D projections that can be post processed to generate different planes in z. With improvements in detector speeds, it has become possible to leverage some combination of spatial and temporal multiplexing techniques to address drawbacks of previous methods. Depending on how they are implemented however, these methods can be cumbersome to implement or use the input laser power inefficiently. 

This week in Journal club we talked about a paper on simultaneous multiplane two-photon imaging from the Mertz group at Boston University. This paper describes a clever temporal multiplexing technique to have near simultaneous imaging of multiple sample planes, by introducing an additional loop known as a reverberation loop.  The system is very similar to a typical two-photon system with the exception of a 4-f loop introduced before the scan mirrors. As can be seen in the system set-up below,

Input laser light is split into two, with one part going to the sample and one part entering the loop. The two lenses in the loop are slightly offset from the actual 4-f configuration so that each pass through the loop changes the focus at the sample plane. This can be easily adjusted using a translation stage. Thus we see that we can get a theoretically infinite set of axially distributed foci that can be used to image multiple planes simultaneously. While the input power is decreasing moving from the thickest part of the sample to the surface, choosing the separation between planes correctly can lead to identical fluorescent power from each plane due to the fact that we have lower scattering as we move closer to the sample surface. This makes extremely efficient use of the laser power. This plane separation may not always be desirable and it is very simple to normalize different powers computationally, although the SNR at different planes will be different. Since the reverberation loop introduces an additional optical path length, different planes are excited at different times. The only requirement is that the time delay introduced by the reverberation loop is higher than the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore used, and that the detector be fast enough. The entire reverberation loop consists of a simple add-on that can be combined with any existing MPM system. The input and fluorescent power and the temporal multiplexing are shown in the figure below.

Thus the authors are able to design a simple and effective system for simultaneous multiplane imaging @ 30 Hz without the need for expensive or complicated hardware.  The axial distribution of planes is very efficient in terms of total power, and due to the initial beamsplitter, only twice the amount of power is required to reach the same depth as a traditional MPM system, irrespective of the number of axial planes. This modality doesn’t sacrifice lateral or axial spatial resolution for the sake of speed and can thus be used for high-resolution, functional in-vivo imaging. In this paper, the authors demonstrate the applications of their technique to image resting state cortical activity in the mouse brain as well as responses in the olfactory bulb when presented with different odorants. While an imaging speed of 30 Hz is more than enough for the examples presented, for higher speed applications, Kilohertz MPM systems might need to be considered which are often more involved and complicated and may trade off resolution or efficiency for a much higher imaging speed.
