## Outline  for Writing Blog Post 
The outline will give you a bare-bones structure of the post we are writing. It is not just a list of the topics, but rather a description of the ideas we want to convey. This will vary a lot from one post to another, but a general outline will contain the following:

- What is the main takeaway?
- Why is this takeaway of any relevance to readers?
- What are the important facts that readers need to know?
- What are some technical concepts that people would need to understand to get my point?
- A conclusion: this can be an open question for readers or potential applications.
